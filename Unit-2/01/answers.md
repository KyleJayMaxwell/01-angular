##What are possible issues with this new file structure?
Not including all files, or forgetting to link them up.

##When thinking about extending the single responsibility principle to the app structure, what are some other ways that the app could be structured?
Anyway just wouldn't be the most logical.

##What are the differences between serving files from an http server and from the file system? It seemed to work fine with just open index.html in the browser...
A server monitors the changes while opening index is just once. 

##Reflecting on the new structure and thinking back to lesson 1 - is Angular an MVC framework? How does the app structure support/disprove that?
Supports it more, because we are still having data exchange with eachother.
